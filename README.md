# Reikai

Reikai is the realm of spirits, both good and evil. Although independent from the natural world, both the spirit world and the natural world are in constant interaction.

As a medium, this project seeks to communicate with the spirit realm that lives within the computer network in the form of lost docker souls that transiently move through Kubernetes planes of existance.
